		<h1>Assignment 2.3 - Building a Web Page Exercise - Part 2</h1>
		<h2>Extra Markup</h2>
		<p class="intro">Hello, my name Is Joshua Kelbley and I am returning to college to obtain a second degree, this one in Software Development. In 2021, I graduated from the University of Toledo with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering </p>
		<p><span class="sentence">I was required to complete three co-operative experiences, or internships where you focus solely on learning from the work experience you are given.</span> I completed my co-ops at Whirlpool in Clyde, Ohio where I was tasked with updating their internal plant websites and helping in their HR department. Currently, I work as an IT Technician for the Wood County Commissioners and as Kitchen Manager at Chipotle Mexican Grill.</p>
		<p>Some of the programming languages I learned throughout my college career were Java, C++, C, and C#. During my co-ops, I became proficient in Apps Script which is the JavaScript used in Google products such as Sheets, Slides, and Docs. At my current IT job, I am learning how to fix many problems that occur with computers such as not receiving emails and various hardware problems.</p>
		<p>Currently, I have been very occupied with both my jobs and school, but when I do find the time, I enjoy playing various games. Team Fight Tactics is my default video game at the moment. It is an auto-battler, comparable to chess. Instead of moving the pieces, you instead choose them to make a composition to be the last one standing.</p>
